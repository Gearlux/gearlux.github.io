# Profile and Ambition

I am a creative and innovative researcher who likes a challenge. I find it difficult to tolerate that some technical problems remain unsolved and will always go for the extra mile if I believe that a solution is within my capabilities. I am very efficient in the investigation and analysis of image processing, computer vision and related problems and during the break down of an application, I can become very enthusiastic if an ‘out of the box’ solution combined with already existing and proven techniques brings me closer to the final solution or product.

As a team coach, I challenge people to be very open and flexible in terms of ideas and prefer team members who also challenge and convince me their ideas. I truly believe that sharing ideas and looking at challenges from different perspectives is essential to implement the best possible solution. 

As a project lead, I try to divide projects into sub-projects, individually tailored for the team members, who can take the full responsibility and satisfaction of the delivery of a quality solution on-time. As a software architect, I always try to define a flexible solution where research tools are combined with development libraries to be able to make the transition from research to development as efficient as possible. I will always design a framework to both flexible and stable, so that it is easy to verify new research ideas and to transfer these ideas to production as easy as possible.

As an innovation manager and project planner, I manage to capture the long term needs from customers, implement the roadmap to catch up and pass our competitors. With custom Trello scripts, I follow up and adjust the planning to develop competitive solutions. With the mindset of ‘the sky is the limit’, I also prototype innovative ideas from which some ‘differentiators’ are included in the development planning.

My ambition is to combine my experience to identify future opportunities and coach and follow up team members and projects during the efficient development of solutions. In parallel, I like to keep up to date with new technologies and software architecture and further investigate development planning techniques. Preferably, I combine this with hands-on development of technically challenging projects.
