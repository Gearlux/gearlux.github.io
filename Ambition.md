# Profile and Ambition

I am a creative and innovative researcher who likes a challenge. 
I find it difficult to tolerate that some technical problems remain unsolved and will always go for the extra mile if I believe that a solution is within my capabilities. 
I am very efficient in the investigation and analysis of image processing, computer vision and related problems. 
During the break down of an application, I can become very enthusiastic if an ‘out of the box’ solution brings me closer to the final solution or product.
Ideally, this 'out of the box' idea further builds upon already existing and proven techniques.

As a team coach, I challenge people to be very open and flexible in terms of ideas and prefer team members who also challenge and convince me their ideas. 
I truly believe that sharing ideas and looking at challenges from different perspectives is essential to implement the best possible solution. 

As a project lead, I try to divide projects into sub-projects, individually tailored for the team members.
The team-members should be able to take the full responsibility and satisfaction of the delivery of their quality solution on-time. 
At the same time, all members should also be challenged to step a little bit out of their comfort zone.

As a software architect, I always try to define a flexible solution where research tools are combined with development libraries and methodologies.
This enables the transition from research to development as efficient as possible. 
I will always design a framework to be both flexible and stable, so that it is easy to verify new research ideas and easy to transfer these ideas to production.

As an innovation manager, I manage to capture the long term needs from customers and implement a roadmap to catch up and pass competitors. 
With custom Trello scripts, I follow up and adjust the planning for competitive solutions. 
Such a solution development, typically is divided in stages, where the risk of the project is reduced across these stages.

My ambition is to combine my experience to identify future opportunities and coach and follow up team members and projects during the efficient development of solutions. 
In parallel, I like to keep up to date with new technologies and software architecture and further investigate development planning techniques. 
Preferably, I combine this with hands-on development of technically challenging projects.
With the mindset of ‘the sky is the limit’, I also like to prototype innovative ideas from which the ‘differentiators’ are transferred to products.
